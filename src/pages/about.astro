    <br>I enjoy reading📖, music♫, driving🏍️ and claiming my brother’s aquarium🐠🪸 to be mine. I am also an avid photographer.
    <br>I'm currently pursuing my own projects while searching for the right role.
    <br> In my free time I disappoint my parents and watch industrial amounts of anime 📺.
    <br><p><a href="https://aisahihu.me"><b>aisahihu.me</b></a> is me in 0s and 1s. It is a journal, a scrapbook, a collection of collections.
    Filled with what I read, watch and find interesting.</p>
    <p>You can find me on my favourite <a href="https://boxd.it/50YyN"><b>social media.</b></a>
