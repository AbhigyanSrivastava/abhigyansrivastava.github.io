    <br>Interested in me, are you?
    <br>
    <br>I am Abhigyan Srivastava. An electrical engineer by trade, undefined by passion and a wannabe writer. **(¬‿¬)** 
    <br>I enjoy reading, music, driving and claiming my brother’s aquarium to be mine. I am also an avid photographer.
    <br>
    <br> I'm currently pursuing my own projects while searching for the right role.
    <br> In my free time I disappoint my parents and watch industrial amounts of anime.
    <br>[Aisahihu.me](http://aisahihu.me/) is me in 0s and 1s. It is filled with what I read, watch and find interesting. 
    <br>
    <br>You can find me on my favourite [social media](https://boxd.it/50YyN/).
    <br>Or write me on braindeadsherlock@protonmail.com

    <br>My home🏠 off internet is in Uttar Pradesh, India.
