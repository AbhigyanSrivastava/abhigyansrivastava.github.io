Sunday Morning. 
Because I am not in my second lecture or it is a holiday. 
This friend of mine, before taking off on his bicycle, recommended Harry Potter.
“You will enjoy it like Narnia. Probably more.”, he said.
And Off he went, cannot remember if he took notes from me or a pen from my beautiful collection.
I was collecting pens back then.
Still do.

<br> My father had introduced us to cinema from an early age. Whatever his aim was I am pretty sure he succeeded. 
<br>This was the time when I was watching Bollywood movies and had the least interaction with movies in language other than Hindi.
Though I had seen Narnia and the Mummy trilogy. Both were successful in captivating me so I wrote down “Harry Potter Series” on a piece of paper and requested my father to get it for us. He obliged.
I don't remember the time of year this happened but I can say it was 2009 or later. 
Because the DVD my father brought from the ‘shop’ had up until the Half Blood Prince. 
Those 4gb DVDs could hold 6 movies in mpeg format, came wrapped in an A4 sheet featuring movie posters.
<br>Me and my two siblings watched it on repeat for days.
We liked it so much. I still remember, what amazed me the most was the world creation and the way everything came to a full circle. 
Those were my naive days.
<br>
<br>
Back to today.
Audible credits were expiring and I was not willing to go full on Dora the Explorer. Claimed and done with the intention of keeping the collection.
Another day, out of the same laziness, I played the Philosopher's Stone.
My mind was already etched with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Wright and others; so the story seemed even more vibrant.
I remembered most of the story but the excitement was to see what the movies missed.
Ironically i was surprised every now and then with how much and why wasn’t this in the movies.
Also this Harry is quite different  to what I'd seen in the movies. 
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
So much so, the whole series of approx 126hours was finished in a week at 1.15x. Thank you Stephen Fry.
Its not an extraordinary story but a different take on the same good vs evil.
I enjoyed it more as i was reliving my childhood.
If you like the films, you will love the books. 
This review holds true if you enter the books keeping your critic brain silent. 
Else you will ask Why did the purebloods used a train instead of floo powder or apparition?, is this the whole combat system?, and what about the difference between the capabilities of the magic users?,
How were the death eaters punished? 
Many such questions would bother you if you are not careful.
