Advocating for: Taking single pic in personal gatherings.
<br>
Arguments:
<br>
Itâ€™s a canon event when everyone invited is in the room.
Casually, take out your phone and click a photo/selfie. 
Instead of capturing an orchestrated photo, shoot one in which everyone is in their element. 
Let them be and capture that instant. 
<br>
This manoeuvre has few advantages.
You are relieved of the pressure of keeping decent face expression during group selfies. 
And the pic looks lively with that many stories.
The best part, you get to torch the one having weirdest moment.
<br>
Not saying no to a decent organised pic, unfiltered are the best.
> A better momento.
