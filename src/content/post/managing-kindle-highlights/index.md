# Kindle is lob, kindle is not

Like you, I too read on kindle. Unlike many and like few, I too highlight a lot. A lot. 
I write and collect my findings in Obsidian. 
It's a collection of markdown files with stuff I want to keep around for future reference.
Hence these highlights naturally belong there.
But moving them there is not a smooth experience.
Also I haven’t yet found an app that share highlights in Hindi without messing up the characters.
So I figured out a way to have it all. 

## Here is it.

1. When you are finished highlighting, go to annotations(represented by a ring binded notebook) and then use the share button.
2. Share it as email.
3. Then you can share it with available citation style or none at all.
4. Your notebook will be shared as a html file. 
5. Save it and upload or darg and drop it on [this website](https://kindle-formatter.com ) made by this [beautiful person](https://ptrchm.com).
7. Now you can move the markdown file of the highlights in Obsidian.
8. You have two presets available and can be customise if you are into it.

This works for now. My current setup involve reading on kindle and ipad.
If you have a better workflow, I would be delighted to hear from you. ✌️
